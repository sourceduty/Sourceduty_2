## Sourceduty II


If you're considering establishing a subsidiary under the umbrella of Sourceduty, it's essential to understand that a subsidiary is a separate legal entity owned in part or wholly by another company, referred to as the parent company. In the context of Sourceduty, which is a creative digital company founded by Alex Aldridge, focusing on various mediums like industrial design, architecture, graphic design, 3D models, fan art, and programming, a subsidiary could potentially leverage these strengths into specialized areas.

For instance, a subsidiary under Sourceduty could concentrate on a specific niche like virtual reality environments, leveraging the 3D model assets and programming expertise that Sourceduty possesses. This subsidiary could operate with a degree of independence while benefiting from Sourceduty's resources, reputation, and network.

Creating a subsidiary involves several considerations including legal structuring, financial planning, market analysis, and strategic planning to ensure alignment with Sourceduty's overall vision and goals. It's also crucial to maintain clear communication channels between the parent company and the subsidiary to foster synergy and avoid conflicts of interest.

If you're serious about this endeavor, it might be beneficial to discuss this directly with Alex Aldridge or the team at Sourceduty.
